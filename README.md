# Discovering Serverless

## Introduction

When you frowned when hearing the the term **serverless** you are not alone in this universe! Depending on what your background is you probably thought the following:

- Business person: "Yes, we can finally stop paying for hosting our servers"
- Software engineer: "Wohoo, writing code, and deploying code without the hassle of managing servers sounds like a dream" 
- Infra/Ops engineer: "Ohnoo, what a fool! Or what if this is true? Ohnoo I don't want to end up coding all day long, that's my worst nightmare!"


Although talking about **less server management** would avoid a lot of weird frowns when talking about this relatively new paradigm, it certainly does not encompass its true nature, so let's discover **serverless archtiectures**!
